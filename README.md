# Simple__Calculator
A basic calculator application built with Python's tkinter library. It features a graphical user interface for performing standard arithmetic operations and includes robust error handling for invalid input.
This project is a functional, graphical calculator application built using Python's tkinter library. It provides a simple yet effective tool for performing basic arithmetic operations with a clean and responsive user interface.

Key Features:
GUI-Based Interface: The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter, making it interactive and user-friendly. The layout is designed to resemble a standard physical calculator.

Basic Arithmetic Operations: It supports fundamental mathematical operations, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and decimal point input (.).

Parentheses Support: The calculator allows for the use of parentheses () to handle complex expressions and enforce the correct order of operations.

Clear and Calculate Functionality: A dedicated 'C' button clears the current expression, while the '=' button evaluates the full expression to display the result.

Error Handling: The calculator includes robust error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs (e.g., syntax errors, division by zero). An error message box informs the user of the issue and resets the input field.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, with a grid system that ensures buttons and the display field scale correctly when the window is resized.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Structure: The code is organized into a Calculator class, which encapsulates all the application's logic, including button actions and state management (e.g., self.expression). This modular approach makes the code clean, readable, and easy to maintain.

Customizable Aesthetics: The application's visual design uses custom colors for the background, buttons, and text, creating a distinct and modern look.

Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language.

tkinter: Python's standard library for creating GUI applications. It is used for building the main window, frames, buttons, and the display entry field.

tkinter.messagebox: Used to create popup error messages for better user feedback.

eval() function: Python's built-in function is utilized to safely evaluate the string-based mathematical expressions entered by the user.

This calculator project is an excellent demonstration of building a practical desktop application with Python, showcasing a solid understanding of GUI development, event handling, and object-oriented design principles.
